Data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/sandp500/data

1. Scenario Analysis for Portfolio Stress Testing

Objective: Evaluating the performance of financial portfolios under different economic scenarios.

Approach: Developing models to simulate the impact of various macroeconomic scenarios (e.g., financial crises, interest rate changes) on portfolio returns.


2.  Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)

Objective: Calculating and compare the Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) for different portfolios.

Approach: Implementing historical simulation and Monte Carlo simulation techniques to estimate VaR and CVaR.


3. Stress Testing with Factor Models

Objective: Useing factor models to stress test portfolios by simulating the impact of factor movements (e.g., interest rates, inflation) on portfolio returns.

Approach: Implementng multi-factor models (e.g., Fama-French) to analyze the sensitivity of portfolios to different economic factors.


4. Liquidity Risk Assessment in Stress Testing

Objective: Assessing the liquidity risk of portfolios under stressed market conditions.

Approach: Developing models to simulate the impact of liquidity shocks on portfolio performance, considering factors like bid-ask spreads and trading volumes.
